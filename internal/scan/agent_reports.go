Use the source-backed Context Pack once for the complete task.

` + "```" + `

MCP: ` + "`task_context`" + `

` + "```text\n" + `Call goregraph context once with the complete task before reading indexed source.
Treat source_sections as current source already read; do not re-read or grep included ranges.
If source_coverage is complete, continue from the included source without another navigation read.
If source_coverage is partial or none, read only relevant uncovered ranges named by source_omissions or files not represented by source_sections.
If fallback_required is true, confidence is low, or there is not exactly one reliable production entrypoint, stop using GoreGraph.
At most one narrower retry may use an exact route, qualified symbol, or file returned by the first call; never use a call-chain label.
Do not use specialist GoreGraph queries or expert MCP tools.
